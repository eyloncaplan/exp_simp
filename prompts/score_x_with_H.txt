f"""I want to score some math expressions from 1-5 based on how well they follow some guiding principles. Here are the principles:

{H_string}

Here are the expressions:

Expression 1: {exp1}
Expression 2: {exp2}

Now, think out loud about each principle, and how much each expression adheres to the principle. A 1 is no adherence, and a 5 is full adherence. Finally, decide a singular overall score from 1-5 for each expression. At the very end of your response, output only the overall scores in the format:

Expression 1 Score: <score>
Expression 2 Score: <score>
