f"""I want to convert a math expression into a different form, following some guiding principles. However, I want to do it in many steps, one small step at a time. Here are the principles:

{H_string}

Here is my expression:

{exp}

Now, using only the symbols {{+, -, *, /, ^, (, )}} and any numbers, perform just a singular small step to convert this expression using the guiding principles. Output just the converted expression (one singular step toward the correct form). Do not output any text or explanation, only the expression after one singular small step. Do not do more than one small step.
