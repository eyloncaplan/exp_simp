f"""You will be given some stylistic forms of a mathematical expression. You will then be given an expression which violates the forms. Your task is to correct the expression so that it follows the forms, but do no other simplifications or changes. Change the expression as little as possible in order to accommodate the forms. For example, a stylistic form might be "all negative fractions have a minus sign outside the fraction", and the expression might be "(6x+y)/(-4y) + 1 + 1". Then the corrected expression should be "-((6x+y)/(4y)) + 1 + 1". You can use any of the following symbols: {legal_symbols}. You cannot use LaTeX symbols.

Here are your stylistic forms and expression.

Violating Expression
{original_expression}

Think out loud about how the expression violates the forms. Then, think about how to correct this, and write the corrected expression. Finally, output only the corrected expression like this.
