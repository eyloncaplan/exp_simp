f"""You will be given some stylistic forms of a mathematical expression. Then, you will write a complex expression that violates every form. For example, a stylistic form might be "All negative fractions have a minus sign outside the fraction". Then one expression which violates this is "(6x+y)/(-4y)", since the minus sign is inside the denominator. Another example might be "When dividing by a constant, multiply by its reciprocal instead". Then a good example of a violating expression would be "x/4 + y/7 + z*x*y + 6^7", since "x/4" and "y/7" violate the form. You may only use the following symbols in your expression: {legal_symbols}. You cannot use LaTeX symbols. Please use at least {min_symbols} symbols.
Here are your stylistic forms.

Now, think out loud about what it means for an expression to be in the forms, and what it means to be violating the forms, and then write a violating expression. Finally, output only the expression like this.
